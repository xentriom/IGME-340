    "content": "### Today is the day it all begins.\n\nI started by creating a few Figma mockups for the app. I have a few ideas in mind, but I want to keep the design simple and clean. My focus is on the content, making sure it's easy to read and navigate. Curious to see how this all comes together.\n\n{{figmamockups}}\n\n### Diving Into Cupertino Widgets\n\nI got started with development and, after a few minutes, decided to challenge myself by using **Cupertino widgets** for the entire app. That might have been a mistake. There isn't much documentation or many examples out there, so I had to figure things out on my own. I ended up leaning on my Material Design knowledge since there are some similarities.\n\nThe first thing I did was create all the files I thought I would need. Having everything structured from the start helps keep things organized and makes it easier to piece everything together.\n\n### Setting Up Shared Preferences\n\nA few hours in, and I'm finally getting the hang of things. I moved on to implementing **Shared Preferences**, which handles saving user data. Now, the app can keep track of login states and store user favorites.\n\nWith that working, I started focusing on the **login and register screens**. That got me thinking about routing, which we haven't covered in class yet. I found a solution on Stack Overflow and ended up using a router suggested by NiklasPor. Here's the link: [click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51663793/how-to-use-cupertinopageroute-and-named-routes-in-flutter).\n\n### Refining the Login & Register UI\n\nI made good progress, took a break, then came back to tweak the **login and register UI** inside the settings screen. I remember seeing a native login/register screen somewhere, and I've been trying to recreate it from memory. This is about as close as I can get.\n\n{{loginregister}}\n\n### API Integration and Explore Screen\n\nNext, I worked on getting the API set up and integrating it with the explore screen. Without core functionality, the app wouldn't be much of a project. \n\n- First, I created a **class to handle API requests and data fetching** to keep things clean.\n- Then, I used placeholder data in the explore screen to get the UI layout sorted.\n- Once that was ready, I swapped out the placeholder data for actual API responses.\n\nWith that done, I started working on the **three-controller requirement**, which included:\n- A search bar\n- Two dropdown menus\n- A radio button selector\n\n### Fighting the Navigation Bar\n\nWhile researching, I came across the `CupertinoNavigationBar` class, which does what it describes but doesn't quite align with Apple's app design language. Looking at Apple's apps, they use the `CupertinoSliverNavigationBar` class, which provides a large header that transitions into a standard `CupertinoNavigationBar` when scrolled. \n\nI tried implementing it, but after multiple attempts, I couldn't get it to format properly - even after turning to *ChatGPT* out of frustration. It couldn't solve the issue either so I decided to remove it.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\nWith two of the three main features in place, I spent the rest of the day **cleaning up, organizing, and adding comments** to make the code more readable. Not a bad startâ€”looking forward to seeing how this all comes together.",
