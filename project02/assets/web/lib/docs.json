    "content": "Today is the day it all begins. I started by creating a few Figma mockups for the app. I have a few ideas in mind, but I want to keep it simple and clean. My focus is on the content, ensuring it is easy to read and navigate. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.\n\n{{figmamockups}}\n\nI decided to start building, and a few minutes in, I challenged myself to use Cupertino widgets for the entire app. This turned out to be a bit regretful since there was a lack of documentation and examples for them. I had to figure everything out and rely on my knowledge of Material Design, as there were some parallels.\n\nThe first thing I did was create all the possible files I thought I would need. This helps me split up the code neatly and get a sense of how everything will come together.\n\nIt's been a few hours, and now I'm starting to get the hang of it. I decided to tackle the Shared Preferences requirement, which will handle saving user data. It now takes care of logging in and out as well as saving and parsing favorites.\n\nNow that I have the basic save/load functionality, I can start working on the UI for the login/register screens. This made me think about routing, which hasn't been covered in class yet. Stack Overflow came through with a solution, and I used a router suggested by NiklasPor. Stack Overflow link to the article: [click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51663793/how-to-use-cupertinopageroute-and-named-routes-in-flutter 'Stack Overflow').\n\nI think I made decent progress today. I took a break and decided to work on this again since it was actually fun. I revamped the login and register UI in the settings screen. I remember seeing a native login/register screen that I'm trying to recreate from memory, but this seems to be as close as I can get to how I remember it looking.",
